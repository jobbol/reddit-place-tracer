Reddit Place Tracer is a browser based userscript for the 2022 Reddit /r/Place project which adds a transparent image on top of the canvas to aid communities with drawing the same image.  It shows how the canvas should look, where each pixel goes, and what color. The user must manually click on these spots.  It is *not an automated bot* and does not break any rules.
